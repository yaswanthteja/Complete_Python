# Stack


### What is stacks?
A stack is a linear data structure in which the insertion of a new element and removal of an existing element takes place at the same end represented as the top of the stack.

### LIFO (Last In First Out)

This strategy states that the element that is inserted last will come out first. You can take a pile of plates kept on top of each other as a real-life example. The plate which we put last is on the top and since we remove the plate that is at the top, we can say that the plate that was put last comes out first.


### Basic Operations on Stack
In order to make manipulations in a stack, there are certain operations provided to us.

- `push()`: to insert an element into the stack
- `pop()`: to remove an element from the stack
- `top() or peek()`: Returns the top element of the stack.
- `isEmpty()`:  returns true if the stack is empty else false.
- `isFull()`: returns true if the stack is full.
- `size()`: returns the size of the stack.






## 1.Python program to implement a stack.

Problem Description
The program creates a stack and allows the user to perform push and pop operations on it.

Problem Solution
1. Create a class Stack with instance variable items initialized to an empty list.
2. Define methods push, pop and is_empty inside the class Stack.
3. The method push appends data to items.
4. The method pop pops the first element in items.
5. The method is_empty returns True only if items is empty.
6. Create an instance of Stack and present a menu to the user to perform operations on the stack.

Program/Source Code
Here is the source code of a Python program to implement a stack. The program output is shown below.
```
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []
 
    def is_empty(self):
        return self.items == []
 
    def push(self, data):
        self.items.append(data)
 
    def pop(self):
        return self.items.pop()
 
 
s = Stack()
while True:
    print('push <value>')
    print('pop')
    print('quit')
    do = input('What would you like to do? ').split()
 
    operation = do[0].strip().lower()
    if operation == 'push':
        s.push(int(do[1]))
    elif operation == 'pop':
        if s.is_empty():
            print('Stack is empty.')
        else:
            print('Popped value: ', s.pop())
    elif operation == 'quit':
        break
 ```
Program Explanation
1. An instance of Stack is created.
2. The user is presented with a menu to perform push and pop operations on the stack.
3. The chosen operation is performed by calling the corresponding method of the stack.

## 2. Python program to implement a stack using a single queue.

Problem Description
The program creates a stack using a single queue and allows the user to perform push and pop operations on it.

Problem Solution
1. Create a class Queue.
2. Define methods enqueue, dequeue, is_empty and get_size inside the class Queue.
3. Create a class Stack with instance variable q initialized to an empty queue.
4. Pushing is done by enqueuing data to the queue.
5. To pop, the queue is dequeued and enqueued with the dequeued element n â€“ 1 times where n is the size of the queue. This causes the the last element added to the queue to reach the rear of the queue. The queue is dequeued one more time to get the item to be returned.
6. The method is_empty returns True iff the queue is empty.

Program/Source Code
Here is the source code of a Python program to implement a stack using a single queue. The program output is shown below.
```
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):

    def is_empty(self):
        return self.q.is_empty()
 
    def push(self, data):
        self.q.enqueue(data)
 
    def pop(self):
        for _ in range(self.q.get_size() - 1):
            dequeued = self.q.dequeue()
            self.q.enqueue(dequeued)
        return self.q.dequeue()
 
 
class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []
        self.size = 0
 
    def is_empty(self):
        return self.items == []
 
    def enqueue(self, data):
        self.size += 1
        self.items.append(data)
 
    def dequeue(self):
        self.size -= 1
        return self.items.pop(0)
 
    def get_size(self):
        return self.size
 
 
s = Stack()
 
print('Menu')
print('push <value>')
print('pop')
print('quit')
 
while True:
    do = input('What would you like to do? ').split()
 
    operation = do[0].strip().lower()
    if operation == 'push':
        s.push(int(do[1]))
    elif operation == 'pop':
        if s.is_empty():
            print('Stack is empty.')
        else:
            print('Popped value: ', s.pop())
    elif operation == 'quit':
        break
