## 1.Python program to solve the fractional knapsack problem using greedy algorithm.

#### Problem Description

In the fractional knapsack problem, we are given a set of n items. Each item i has a value v(i) and a weight w(i) where 0 <= i < n. We are given a maximum weight W. The problem is to find how much of each item we should take such that the total weight does not exceed W and the total value is maximized. Thus, we want to find f such that sum of v(i)f(i) over all i is maximized, w(i)f(i) <= W for all i and 0 <= f(i) <= 1 for all i.

Problem Solution
1. The function fractional_knapsack is defined.
2. It takes three arguments: two lists value and weight; and a number capacity.
3. It returns (max_value, fractions) where max_value is the maximum value of items with total weight not more than capacity.
4. fractions is a list where fractions[i] is the fraction that should be taken of item i, where 0 <= i < total number of items.
5. The function works by choosing an item from the remaining items that has the maximum value to weight ratio.
6. If the knapsack can include the entire weight of the item, then the full amount of the item is added to the knapsack.
7. If not, then only a fraction of this item is added such that the knapsack becomes full.
8. The above three steps are repeated until the knapsack becomes full, i.e. the total weight reaches the maximum weight.

## 2.Python program to solve the interval scheduling problem using greedy algorithm.

Problem Description
In the interval scheduling problem, we are given n activities numbered 0 to n â€“ 1. Each activity i has a start time s(i) and a finish time f(i). Two activities i and j are mutually compatible if s(i) >= f(j) or s(j) >= f(i). The problem is to find a largest subset of activities that are mutually compatible.

Problem Solution
1. The function interval_scheduling is defined.
2. It takes two lists stimes and ftimes as arguments.
3. stimes[i] is the start time of activity i.
4. ftimes[i] is the finish time of activity i.
5. The algorithm works by first sorting the activities in order of earliest finish times.
6. Then the activity with the earliest finish time is included in the solution set.
7. All the activities that are incompatible with the activity just added are removed.
8. The above two steps are repeated until there are no remaining activities.
9. The solution set is returned which is a maximum-size subset of mutually compatible activities.

## 3. Python program to find smallest set of unit-length closed intervals that contains all points using greedy algorithm.

Problem Description
We are given a set of points on the x-axis. We have to find the minimum number of closed intervals of length 1 that will contain all of these points.

Problem Solution

6. All the points that are included within this interval are discarded.
7. The next rightmost point q is selected and the closed interval [q, q + 1] is included.
8. The above process continues until there are no remaining points.

## 4. Python program to minimize maximum lateness using greedy algorithm.

Problem Description
We are given n requests numbered 0 to n â€“ 1. Each request i has a time that it takes to complete t(i) and a deadline d(i). If a request i starts at time s(i), then its finish time is f(i) = s(i) + t(i). The lateness of request i is L(i) = f(i) â€“ d(i) if f(i) > d(i). The maximum value of L(i) over all i is called the maximum lateness. That is, maximum lateness = max(L(0), L(1), â€¦, L(n â€“ 1)). The problem is to schedule all the requests such that the value of maximum lateness is minimized.

Problem Solution
1. The function minimize_lateness defined.
2. It takes two lists ttimes and dtimes as arguments.
3. ttimes[i] is the time taken to complete request i.
4. dtimes[i] is the deadline of request i.
5. The algorithm works by sorting the requests in order of earliest deadline.
6. This ordering is an optimal way to schedule the requests to minimize maximum lateness.
7. The minimum maximum lateness is then calculated.
8. The minimum maximum lateness and the optimal schedule ordering is returned.
