##  Python program to illustrate the operations of a singly linked list.

Problem Description
The program creates a singly linked list and presents the user with a menu to perform various operations on the list.

Problem Solution
1. Create a class Node with instance variables data and next.
2. Create a class LinkedList with instance variable head.
3. The variable head points to the first element in the singly linked list.
4. Define methods get_node, get_prev_node, insert_after, insert_before, insert_at_beg, insert_at_end, remove and display.
5. get_node takes an index as argument and traverses the list from the first node that many times to return the node at that index.
6. get_prev_node takes a reference node as argument and returns the previous node. It returns None when the reference node is the first node.
7. The methods insert_after and insert_before insert a node after or before some reference node in the list.
8. The methods insert_at_beg and insert_at_end insert a node at the first or last position of the list.
9. The method remove takes a node as argument and removes it from the list.
10. The method display traverses the list from the first node and prints the data of each node.
11. Create an instance of LinkedList and present the user with a menu to perform operations on the list.

Program Explanation
1. An instance of LinkedList is created.
2. The user is presented with a menu to perform various operations on the list.
3. The corresponding methods are called to perform each operation.
