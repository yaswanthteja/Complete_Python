## 1. Python program to implement a binomial tree.

Problem Description
The program creates binomial trees and presents a menu to the user to perform operations on these trees.

Problem Solution
1. Create a class BinomialTree with instance variables key, children and order. children is set to an empty list and order is set to 0 when an object is instantiated.
2. Define method add_at_end which takes a binomial tree of the same order as argument and adds it to the current tree, increasing its order by 1.

Program/Source Code
Here is the source code of a Python program to implement a binomial tree. The program output is shown below.
```
class BinomialTree:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.key = key
        self.children = []
        self.order = 0
 
    def add_at_end(self, t):
        self.children.append(t)
        self.order = self.order + 1
 
 
trees = []
 
print('Menu')
print('create <key>')
print('combine <index1> <index2>')
print('quit')
 
while True:
    do = input('What would you like to do? ').split()
 
    operation = do[0].strip().lower()
    if operation == 'create':
        key = int(do[1])
        btree = BinomialTree(key)
        trees.append(btree)
        print('Binomial tree created.')
    elif operation == 'combine':
        index1 = int(do[1])
        index2 = int(do[2])
        if trees[index1].order == trees[index2].order:
            trees[index1].add_at_end(trees[index2])
            del trees[index2]
            print('Binomial trees combined.')
        else:
            print('Orders of the trees need to be the same.')
 
    elif operation == 'quit':
        break
 
    print('{:>8}{:>12}{:>8}'.format('Index', 'Root key', 'Order'))
    for index, t in enumerate(trees):
        print('{:8d}{:12d}{:8d}'.format(index, t.key, t.order))
 ```
Program Explanation
1. An empty list is created to store the binomial trees.
2. The user is presented with a menu to create and combine two binomial trees.
3. Only trees of the same order k are allowed to combine to form a tree of order k + 1.
4. The corresponding methods are called to perform each operation.

## 2.  Python program to construct a tree and perform insertion, deletion and display operations.

Problem Description
The program creates a tree and presents a menu to the user to perform insertion, deletion and display operations.

Problem Solution
1. Create a class Tree with instance variables key and children.
2. Define methods set_root, add, remove, bfs_display and search.
3. The method set_root takes a key as argument and sets the instance variable key equal to it.
4. The method add appends a node to the list children.
5. The method search returns a node with a specified key.
6. The method remove removes the current node from the tree.
7. The method bfs_display displays the BFS traversal of the tree.

Program/Source Code
Here is the source code of a Python program to construct a tree and perform insertion, deletion and display operations. The program output is shown below.
```
class Tree:

            if tree is not None:
                ref_node = tree.search(key)
            if ref_node is None:
                print('No such key.')
                continue

        else:
            print('Tree is empty.')
 
    elif operation == 'quit':
        break
```
Program Explanation
1. A variable is created to store the binary tree.
2. The user is presented with a menu to perform operations on the tree.
3. The corresponding methods are called to perform each operation.
4. If the node to be removed is the root node, the removal is carried out by finding a leaf node and replacing the root with it. If the node to be removed is not the root node then the remove method is called on the node.

## 3.Python program to find the number of nodes in a binary tree.

Problem Description
The program creates a binary tree and counts the number of nodes in the tree.

Problem Solution
1. Create a class BinaryTree with instance variables key, left and right.
2. Define methods set_root, insert_left, insert_right, inorder and search.
3. The method set_root takes a key as argument and sets the variable key equal to it.
4. The methods insert_left and insert_right insert a node as the left and right child respectively.
5. The method inorder displays the inorder traversal.
6. The method search returns a node with a specified key.
7. Define the function count_nodes which takes a binary tree as argument.
8. The recursive function count_nodes returns the number of nodes in the binary tree.

Program/Source Code
Here is the source code of a Python program to count the number of nodes in a binary tree. The program output is shown below.
