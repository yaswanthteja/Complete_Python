# What is a Data Structure in python?
The Data Structure is a description of how data is organised (stored), modified, and accessed. By specifying how different sorts of data connect to one another, it also develops relationships and forms algorithms. The data structure of any computer language is a crucial concept in algorithmic design.


# What Are the Various Data Structure Types?
The numerous forms of data structures are as follows:

- Lists : Lists are a collection of related objects that are linked to the data items before and after them.

 - Arrays: Arrays are a collection of values with the same value.

- Stacks: LIFO data structures, or stacks, are those in which the element placed last is accessed first.

- Queues: Queues are a first-in-first-out data structure.

- Graphs: In this data structure, data values are stored in nodes connected by edges.

- Trees: Like a linked list, the data values are linked in a hierarchical structure.

- Hash table: A table in which each value is assigned a key and then preserved, making individual values more accessible.

- Heaps: A binary tree data structure that allows you to compare parent and child data values.

# What Applications Do Data Structures Have?
Data structures are useful for a number of things, including:

- Dynamic memory allocation should be implemented.

- Model sets and other types of data

- Network modelling

- Identifying and resolving the most basic issues




# : Create a list by picking an odd-index items from the first list and even index items from the second
Given two lists, l1 and l2, write a program to create a third list l3 by picking an odd-index element from the list l1 and even index elements from the list l2.

Given:
```
l1 = [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21]
l2 = [4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28]
```

Expected Output:
```
Element at odd-index positions from list one
[6, 12, 18]
Element at even-index positions from list two
[4, 12, 20, 28]

Printing Final third list
[6, 12, 18, 4, 12, 20, 28]
```

`Solution`

To access a range of items in a list, use the slicing operator :. With this operator, you can specify where to start the slicing, end, and specify the step.

For example, the expression list1[ start : stop : step] returns the portion of the list from index start to index stop, at a step size step.

- for 1st list: Start from the 1st index with step value 2 so it will pick elements present at index 1, 3, 5, and so on
- for 2nd list: Start from the 0th index with step value 2 so it will pick elements present at index 0, 2, 4, and so on

```
list1 = [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21]
list2 = [4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28]
res = list()

odd_elements = list1[1::2]
print("Element at odd-index positions from list one")
print(odd_elements)

even_elements = list2[0::2]
print("Element at even-index positions from list two")
print(even_elements)

print("Printing Final third list")
res.extend(odd_elements)
res.extend(even_elements)
print(res)
```



2: Remove and add item in a list
Write a program to remove the item present at index 4 and add it to the 2nd position and at the end of the list.

Given:
```
list1 = [54, 44, 27, 79, 91, 41]
```

Expected Output:
```
List After removing element at index 4  [34, 54, 67, 89, 43, 94]
List after Adding element at index 2  [34, 54, 11, 67, 89, 43, 94]
List after Adding element at last  [34, 54, 11, 67, 89, 43, 94, 11]
```
 `Solution`
 ```
pop(index): Removes and returns the item at the given index from the list.
insert(index, item): Add the item at the specified position(index) in the list
append(item): Add item at the end of the list.
sample_list = [34, 54, 67, 89, 11, 43, 94]

print("Original list ", sample_list)
element = sample_list.pop(4)
print("List After removing element at index 4 ", sample_list)

sample_list.insert(2, element)
print("List after Adding element at index 2 ", sample_list)

sample_list.append(element)
print("List after Adding element at last ", sample_list)

```


## Sequential Search:
The searching algorithms are the algorithms that are used to search a particular value in a data structure such as lists in Python. For example, imagine that you are trying to find a specific card from a deck of cards. You will go through each card in the deck one by one until you find the card you are looking for. Once you got the card you were looking for you will stop. This is how the sequential search algorithm works. Here is how to implement it using Python:
```
def sequential_search(list_, n):
    for i in list_:
        if i == n:
            break
    return True
  
  
elements = range(0, 20)
ss = sequential_search(elements, 4)
print(ss)
```
## Validate Anagrams:
An Anagram is a word or phrase that forms a different word or phrase when the letters of a word are rearranged. For example, the words “despair” and “praised” are anagrams. The validation of anagram words is one of the favourite questions in coding interviews. The idea is to write an algorithm to check if the input word creates a meaningful word when rearranged. So to validate an anagram using Python, we need to input two words and check if word1 in any case matches word2 after rearranging the words. Here is how to validate anagrams using Python:

```
def anagram(word1, word2):
    word1 = word1.lower()
    word2 = word2.lower()
    return sorted(word1) == sorted(word2)

print(anagram("cinema", "iceman"))
print(anagram("cool", "loco"))
print(anagram("men", "women"))
```
