# Recursion
Explanation of recursion
Recursion is a technique used in Python programming that allows a function to call itself in order to solve a problem. The recursive function is designed to break down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, and then solve each sub-problem recursively until the entire problem is solved.

In Python, a recursive function typically has two parts: the base case and the recursive case. The base case is the condition that stops the recursion and provides a result for the smallest sub-problem. The recursive case is the condition that allows the function to call itself and solve the sub-problem.

Here's an example of a recursive function in Python that calculates the factorial of a number:

In this example, the factorial function takes a single parameter n, which represents the number whose factorial is to be calculated. The base case is n == 0, which returns 1. The recursive case is n * factorial(n-1), which calls the factorial function with a smaller value of n. This process continues until the base case is reached and the function returns the final result.

It's important to note that recursive functions can lead to stack overflow errors if the recursion depth is too deep. This can occur if the base case is not reached within a reasonable number of recursive calls. Therefore, it's important to carefully design recursive functions to ensure that the base case is reached in a timely manner.

## Recursive functions
In Python, a recursive function is a function that calls itself within its own body. Recursive functions are useful when you need to solve a problem by dividing it into smaller subproblems that can be solved recursively.

Here's an example of a simple recursive function in Python that calculates the factorial of a given number:

In this example, the factorial function takes an integer n as an argument and returns the factorial of n. If n is equal to 0, the function returns 1. Otherwise, the function returns n multiplied by the factorial of n-1, which is calculated by calling the factorial function recursively with the argument n-1.

Here's an example of how you could use the factorial function:

This returns the factorial of 5, which is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120.

It's important to note that recursive functions can be inefficient and may lead to stack overflow errors if the recursion depth is too high. Therefore, it's important to use them judiciously and ensure that they have a base case that will eventually terminate the recursion.
