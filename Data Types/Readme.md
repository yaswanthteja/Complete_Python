Python has several built-in data types to represent different kinds of values. Here are some of the fundamental data types in Python:

1. **Numeric Types:**
    - **`int`:** Integer type represents whole numbers, e.g., 10, -3, 42.
    - **`float`:** Float type represents floating-point numbers, e.g., 3.14, -0.5, 2e10.
    
    Example:
    
    ```python
    
    integer_number = 42
    float_number = 3.14
    
    ```
    
2. **Boolean Type:**
    - **`bool`:** Boolean type represents boolean values **`True`** or **`False`**.
    
    Example:
    
    ```python
    
    is_python_fun = True
    is_learning = False
    
    ```
    
3. **Text Type:**
    - **`str`:** String type represents sequences of characters enclosed in single or double quotes.
    
    Example:
    
    ```python
    
    message = 'Hello, World!'
    
    ```
    
4. **Sequence Types:**
    - **`list`:** List type represents ordered sequences of values, and it is mutable (can be modified).
    - **`tuple`:** Tuple type represents ordered sequences of values, and it is immutable (cannot be modified).
    - **`range`:** Range type represents sequences of numbers, often used in loops.
    
    Examples:
    
    ```python
    
    my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    my_tuple = (10, 20, 30)
    my_range = range(0, 5)
    
    ```
    
5. **Mapping Type:**
    - **`dict`:** Dictionary type represents key-value pairs, where each key must be unique.
    
    Example:
    
    ```python
    
    student = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'grade': 'A'}
    
    ```
    
6. **Set Types:**
    - **`set`:** Set type represents an unordered collection of unique elements.
    - **`frozenset`:** Frozenset type is an immutable version of a set.
    
    Examples:
    
    ```python
    
    my_set = {1, 2, 3}
    my_frozenset = frozenset([4, 5, 6])
    
    ```
    
7. **Binary Types:**
    - **`bytes`:** Bytes type represents sequences of bytes and is immutable.
    - **`bytearray`:** Bytearray type represents sequences of bytes and is mutable.
    - **`memoryview`:** Memoryview type represents a view of the memory, mainly used with **`bytes`**.
    
    Examples:
    
    ```python
    
    binary_data = b'Hello'
    mutable_binary_data = bytearray(b'World')
    
    ```
    
8. **None Type:**
    - **`None`:** Represents the absence of a value or a null value.
    
    Example:
    
    ```python
    
    no_value = None
    
    ```
    

These are the core data types in Python. Understanding these types is fundamental to working effectively with Python's powerful and flexible features.
