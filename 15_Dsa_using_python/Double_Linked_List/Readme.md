## 1.Python program to implement a circular doubly linked list.

Problem Description
The program creates a circular doubly linked list and presents the user with a menu to perform various operations on the list.

Problem Solution
1. Create a class Node with instance variables data and next.
2. Create a class CircularDoublyLinkedList with instance variable first.
3. The variable first points to the first element in the circular doubly linked list.
4. Define methods get_node, insert_after, insert_before, insert_at_beg, insert_at_end, remove and display.
5. get_node takes an index as argument and traverses the list from the first node that many times to return the node at that index. It stops if it reaches the first node again.
6. The methods insert_after and insert_before insert a node after or before some reference node in the list.
7. The methods insert_at_beg and insert_at_end insert a node at the first or last position of the list. insert_at_beg modifies the variable first to point to the new node.
8. The method remove takes a node as argument and removes it from the list.
9. The method display traverses the list from the first node and prints the data of each node until it reaches the first node again.
10. Create an instance of CircularDoublyLinkedList and present the user with a menu to perform operations on the list.

## 2.Python program to find the largest element in a doubly linked list.

Problem Description
The program creates a doubly linked list and finds the largest element in the list.

Problem Solution
1. Create a class Node with instance variables data and next.
2. Create a class DoublyLinkedList with instance variables first and last.
3. The variable first points to the first element in the doubly linked list while last points to the last element.
4. Define methods insert_at_end and append.
5. The method insert_at_end inserts a node at the last position of the list.
6. The method append takes a data item as argument and appends a node with that data item to the list.
7. The function find_largest takes a linked list as argument and returns the largest element in the list. It returns None if the list is empty.
8. Create an instance of DoublyLinkedList, append data to it and find the largest element in it.

Program/Source Code
Here is the source code of a Python program to find the largest element in a doubly linked list.
```
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
       self.data = data
       self.next = None
       self.prev = None

    def insert_at_end(self, new_node):
        if self.last is None:
            self.last = new_node
            self.first = new_node
        else:
            new_node.prev = self.last
            self.last.next = new_node
            self.last = new_node
 
 
def find_largest(dllist):
    if dllist.first is None:
        return None
    largest = dllist.first.data
    current = dllist.first.next
    while current:
        if current.data > largest:
            largest = current.data
        current = current.next
    return largest
 
 
a_dllist = DoublyLinkedList()
 
data_list = input('Please enter the elements in the doubly linked list: ').split()
for data in data_list:
    a_dllist.append(int(data))
 
largest = find_largest(a_dllist)
if largest:
    print('The largest element is {}.'.format(largest))
else:
    print('The list is empty.')
```
Program Explanation
1. An instance of DoublyLinkedList is created.
2. The user is prompted to enter the data items of the list.
3. The largest element is found by calling find_largest.
4. The result is displayed.
```
Runtime Test Cases
Case 1:
Please enter the elements in the doubly linked list: 5 10 9 3
The largest element is 10.
 
Case 2:
Please enter the elements in the doubly linked list: 
The list is empty.
 
Case 3:
Please enter the elements in the doubly linked list: 234 10 4 200
The largest element is 234.
