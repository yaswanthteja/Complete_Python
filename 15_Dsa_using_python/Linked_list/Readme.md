for i in range(n):
    data = int(input('Enter data item: '))
    a_llist.append(data)
print('The linked list: ', end = '')
a_llist.display()
```
Program Explanation

2. The user is asked for the number of elements they would like to add. This is stored in n.
3. Using a loop, data from the user is appended to the linked list n times.
4. The linked list is displayed.

```
Runtime Test Cases
Case 1:
How many elements would you like to add? 5
Enter data item: 3
Enter data item: -2
Enter data item: 1
Enter data item: 5
Enter data item: 0
The linked list: 3 -2 1 5 0 
 
Case 2:
How many elements would you like to add? 1
Enter data item: 6
The linked list: 6 
 
Case 3:
How many elements would you like to add? 4
Enter data item: 2
