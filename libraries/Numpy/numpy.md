NumPy

The NumPy library is the core library for scientific computing in Python. It provides a  high-performance multidimensional array object and tools for working with these arrays.  

Use the following import convention:  
```
 import numpy as np
```


### Creating Arrays 

```
 a = np.array([1,2,3])
 b = np.array([(1.5,2,3), (4,5,6)], dtype = float)
 c = np.array([[(1.5,2,3), (4,5,6)],[(3,2,1), (4,5,6)]], dtype = float)
```
