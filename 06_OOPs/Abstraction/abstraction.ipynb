    "For example, when we go to an ATM we can perform various tasks like withdrawing cash, checking balance, retrieving statements, changing a PIN, and many more so while performing these tasks we don’t know the internal implementation of the tasks. That’s how abstraction is useful when we want to show only the required information to the user while hiding other information."
