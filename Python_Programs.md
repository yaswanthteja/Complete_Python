## 10  Can we reverse a list in Python?
Yes, we can reserve a list in Python using the reverse() method. The code is as follows:
```
def reverse(s):
 str = "" 
 for i in s: 
   str = i + str
  return str
  
  ```




## 11 Write a Python script to implement the Bubble sort algorithm.
Code
```
# Python program to show how to implement bubble sort  
  
def bubble_Sort(array):  
    n = len(array)  
  
for i in range(n-1):  
         
for j in range(0, n-i-1):  
             
if array[j] > array[j + 1] :  
                array[j], array[j + 1] = array[j + 1], array[j]  
     
print(array)  
  
#example array  
arr = [23, 14, 64, 13, 64, 23, 86]  
  
bubble_Sort(arr)

## 12 In Python, create a program that generates a Fibonacci sequence.
Code
```
#taking number of terms to print the series  
n = 9  
first = 0 #first value of series  
second = 1 #second value of series  
series = [first, second]  
if n == 0:  
     
print("The required fibonacci series is",first)  
else:  
     
for i in range(0,n-2):   
         
num = series[i] + series[i+1]  
         
series.append(num)  
print(series)  
```
```
Output:

[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21]
```

## 13 Remove duplicates from sorted array
Given an integer sorted array in increasing order, remove the duplicate numbers such that each unique element appears only once. Make sure you keep the final order of the array the same.

It is impossible to change the length of the array in Python, so we will place the result in the first part of the array. After removing duplicates, we will have k elements, and the first k elements in the array should hold the results. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93423367/216781101-b3050608-9c0c-435d-90a6-f0945a39ce46.png)


Example 1: input array is [1,1,2,2], the function should return 2. 

Example 2: input array is [1,1,2,3,3], the function should return 3.

Solution:

- Run the loop for the range of 1 to the size of the array.
- Check if the previous number is unique or not. We are comparing previous elements with the current one.  
- If it is unique, update the array using insertIndex, which is 1 at the start, and add +1 to the insertIndex. 
- Return insertIndex as it is the k. 
- This question is relatively straightforward once you know how. If you put more time into understanding the statement, you can easily come up with a solution.


```
def removeDuplicates(array):
    size = len(array)
    insertIndex = 1
    for i in range(1, size):
        if array[i - 1] != array[i]:
            # Updating insertIndex in our main array
            array[insertIndex] = array[i]
            # Incrementing insertIndex count by 1
            insertIndex = insertIndex + 1
    return insertIndex

array_1 = [1,2,2,3,3,4]
removeDuplicates(array_1)
# 4


array_2 = [1,1,3,4,5,6,6]
removeDuplicates(array_2)
# 5
```
# 14 Find the maximum single sell profit
You are provided with the list of stock prices, and you have to return the buy and sell price to make the highest profit. 

Note: We have to make maximum profit from a single buy/sell, and if we canâ€™t make a profit, we have to reduce our losses. 

Example 1: stock_price = [8, 4, 12, 9, 20, 1], buy = 4, and sell = 20. Maximizing the profit. 

Example 2: stock_price = [8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], buy = 6, and sell = 5. Minimizing the loss.

Solution:

- We will calculate the global profit by subtracting global sell (the first element in the list) from current buy (the second element in the list). 
- Run the loop for the range of 1 to the length of the list. 
- Within the loop, calculate the current profit using list elements and current buy value. 
- If the current profit is greater than the global profit, change the global profit with the current profit and global sell to the i element of the list.
- If the current buy is greater than the current element of the list, change the current buy with the current element of the list. 
- In the end, we will return global buy and sell value. To get global buy value, we will subtract global sell from global profit.
- The question is a bit tricky, and you can come up with your unique algorithm to solve the problems. 

```
def buy_sell_stock_prices(stock_prices):
    current_buy = stock_prices[0]
    global_sell = stock_prices[1]
    global_profit = global_sell - current_buy

    for i in range(1, len(stock_prices)):
        current_profit = stock_prices[i] - current_buy

        if current_profit > global_profit:
            global_profit = current_profit
            global_sell = stock_prices[i]

        if current_buy > stock_prices[i]:
            current_buy = stock_prices[i]

    return global_sell - global_profit, global_sell

stock_prices_1 = [10,9,16,17,19,23]
buy_sell_stock_prices(stock_prices_1)
# (9, 23)


stock_prices_2 = [8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
buy_sell_stock_prices(stock_prices_2)
# (6, 5)

```



## 15 How would you convert a list into a tuple?


```

my_list = [50, "Twenty", 110, "Fifty", "Ten", 20, 10, 80, "Eighty"]
 
my_tuple = (my_list[0], my_list[len(my_list) - 1], len(my_list))
print(my_tuple)

```
All we have to do is create a tuple with three elements. The first element of the tuple is the first element of the list, which can be found using my_list[0].

The second element of the tuple is the last element in the list. my_list[len(my_list) - 1] will give us this element. We could also have used the pop() method, but that would alter the list.


## Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five
- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number
- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop



Given:
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
Expected output:
```

75
150
145
```
Solution
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
# iterate each item of a list
for item in numbers:
    if item > 500:
        break
    elif item > 150:
        continue
    # check if number is divisible by 5
    elif item % 5 == 0:
        print(item)
```

```
count = int(input("Enter the count of numbers: "))

    x = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
    sum = sum + x
avg = sum/count
print("The average is: ", avg)
```
Output:
```
Enter the count of numbers: 5
Enter an integer: 3

        isprime = 0
        break
if(isprime==1):
    print(num, "is a prime number")
else:
    print(num, "is not a prime number")
```
Output:
```
Enter an integer greater than 1: 7
7 is a prime number
Enter an integer greater than 1: 24
24 is not a prime number

```
